After cleaning my face, I spread serum on and put on the mask, click buttons for several times to set the color of light, brightness and time and that's it. I tried red light the first day for 20 minutes, the serum absorbed nicely after, and the next morning my face was glowing, I guess it really works, I will take turn try other color of lights later.

I put it on for 20 minutes on an evening when I sit down - it's a nice reason to take a break! Hopeful this may work long term. Seems fine in short times of use.
